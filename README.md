Capstone project for Data Science Certificate Program at Georgetown University - School of Continuing Studies. 

The objective of this project is to predict how many people will be present at a given time in our classroom. To achieve this, we will use several sensors attached to a Raspberry Pi to capture data such as temperature, humidity, and CO2 levels among other information, as our input features. We will also manually log the number of people entering and exiting the room as part of our observed results.
Later on, using Python machine learning libraries, several models will be trained over subsets of the collected data to effectively predict occupancy in the classroom.

For more details on the sensors, please go to SensorDataCollection sub-project.
